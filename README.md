# sensecap-dashboard

Web dashboard for all sensors on the SenseCAP / SenseCraft Data Platform: live map, history charts, device table and CSV download.

The server keeps your API credentials private and calls the SenseCAP HTTP API; the browser only talks to this server.

## Run locally

```bash
npm start            # real data, needs the variables below
npm run demo         # demo data, no credentials needed
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

## Variables

| Name | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SENSECAP_API_ID` | yes | API ID from Security, Access API keys |
| `SENSECAP_API_KEY` | yes | Access API Key from the same page |
| `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` | no | Asks visitors for this password (any username) |
| `SENSECAP_HOST` | no | Defaults to `https://sensecap.seeed.cc/openapi` |
| `DEMO` | no | `1` forces demo data |

Never commit real keys. `.env` is ignored by git.

## Notes

- Groups in SenseCAP show up as the group filter, so create one group per school.
- History uses the `aggregate_chart_points` endpoint (up to about 250 points per series).
- Device lists are cached for 1 minute and readings for 1 to 2 minutes to stay within API limits.

## 3D view

`/3d.html` shows Cyprus as a 3D island: terrain coloured by temperature, elevation, PM2.5 or dust, animated wind, clouds and rain, sea points, and one column per sensor. It refreshes sensors every 30 seconds and weather every 5 minutes.

Outside data comes from [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com) (free, no key, non-commercial use): elevation, weather, air quality and marine conditions. Sensors are compared with the weather model for temperature and humidity.

`OPEN_METEO_MOCK=1` serves synthetic terrain and weather for offline testing only.
